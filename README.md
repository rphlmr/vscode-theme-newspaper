This theme is inspired by Quiet Light.

It is a simple light theme with few colors (all from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) CSS -800).

No yellow, green or red tokens (I have a hard time reading them on a light background).

Typescript types are dimmed, like comments.

**Enjoy!**
